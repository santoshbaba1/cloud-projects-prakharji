## 7.2 AWS CLI Cleanup

```bash
# 1. Stop the running task (replace TASK_ARN with your actual task ARN)
aws ecs stop-task \
  --cluster ECSBasicsCluster \
  --task TASK_ARN \
  --region us-east-1

# 2. Deregister the task definition
aws ecs deregister-task-definition \
  --task-definition ecs-basics-task:1 \
  --region us-east-1

# 3. Delete the ECS cluster
aws ecs delete-cluster \
  --cluster ECSBasicsCluster \
  --region us-east-1

# 4. Delete the security group (replace SG_ID with your actual SG ID)
aws ec2 delete-security-group \
  --group-id SG_ID \
  --region us-east-1

# 5. Delete the ECR Public repository (delete-repository removes images too)
aws ecr-public delete-repository \
  --repository-name ecs-basics-app \
  --force \
  --region us-east-1

# 6. Delete the CloudWatch log group
aws logs delete-log-group \
  --log-group-name /ecs/ecs-basics-task \
  --region us-east-1

# 7. Detach policy from IAM role before deleting
aws iam detach-role-policy \
  --role-name ECSBasicsTaskExecutionRole \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy

aws iam delete-role \
  --role-name ECSBasicsTaskExecutionRole
```

## 7.3 Verify Everything Is Deleted

```bash
# Check no ECS clusters remain
aws ecs list-clusters --region us-east-1

# Check no task definitions remain active
aws ecs list-task-definitions \
  --family-prefix ecs-basics-task \
  --status ACTIVE \
  --region us-east-1

# Check no log group remains
aws logs describe-log-groups \
  --log-group-name-prefix /ecs/ecs-basics-task \
  --region us-east-1

# Check the IAM role is gone
aws iam get-role --role-name ECSBasicsTaskExecutionRole 2>&1 | grep NoSuchEntity
```
